Motorists rely on our website and mobile apps each month to easily compare the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly rates at thousands of parking facilities, thereby saving hundreds of dollars on parking.                       \r\nThe largest parking operators in the nation have partnered with BestParking to offer reservations, monthly specials, and exclusive deals directly to the site’s users. BestParking’s “Parking Partners” include Icon Parking Systems, Quik Park, Edison ParkFast, Parkway Corp, and other major operators.\r\n\r\nCities – Daily Parking: Motorists can search for parking by neighborhood, address, cross street, or attraction. All parking garages and lots near the search destination will appear on a map and sortable list. Details for each facility are posted, including addresses, valet/park and lock/self-park, indoor/outdoor, clearance height, electric vehicle charging, and SUV/Minivan/Van/Truck regulations. Our system considers all possible pricing variations (e.g., early-bird, evening, holiday specials, and extra overnight charges) before running an instant rate comparison and returning all results for the time period. \r\n\r\nThe default vehicle type is a regular vehicle. If driving an oversize or supersize vehicle, be sure to carefully read the garage/lot information for any surcharges. The definition of an oversize vehicle is anything 181\" or longer and 70\" or higher. It's important to note that while we're able to check official dimensions against the regulations we've been given, the decision to charge for oversize or supersize  is ultimately up to the discretion of the attendant onsite. We advise folks to be prepared to pay an oversize fee if they're driving anything larger than a sedan.\r\nAirports: All on-airport and off-airport garages and lots for every major U.S. airport are displayed on a map and corresponding list below the map. Details for each facility are provided and all rates can be instantly calculated so that motorists can make a fair and unbiased comparison. Both short-term and long-term parking are supported.","help_email":"help@bestparking.com","app_download_urls":{"ios":"https://app.appsflyer.com/id383076098","android":"https://app.appsflyer.com/com.bestparking","onelink":"https://bestparking.onelink.me/3476317416"},"app_image_urls":{"ios":"https://dbmgns9xjyk0b.cloudfront.net/partner-images/production/bestparking/bp-ios-app.png","android":"https://dbmgns9xjyk0b.cloudfront.net/videos/how-it-works-reserve-prepay-save-bp.png","main":"https://dbmgns9xjyk0b.cloudfront.net/partner-images/production/bestparking/bp-main-app.png"},"announcement":{"show_banner":false},"app_video_urls":{"ios":"","android":""},"privacy_policy":"This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is incorporated into our Terms of Use and applies to Arrive Mobility Inc., www.bestparking.com, the BestParking Mobile App, and any third party sites that alloy you make parking reservations via their platforms (eg.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our usage agreement, please email us at legal@arrive.com.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditional Terms and Conditions Specific to Users\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBooked Parking Usage:\r\n\r\nUsers who book parking through the Site must present the parking pass in accordance with the instructions included with the booking to receive their reserved parking space on the day of reservation. If you do not present the parking pass to the Seller or the garage, you will not get credit for the online payment and the online payment will not be refunded at a later date. If you arrive early or stay past your parking time you will be charged the posted rates at the garage, and not the booked rate and you may not receive credit for your online payment, that is within the discretion of the garage. The parking booked is valid only for the times listed on the parking pass. You are responsible for ensuring that you arrive at the booked parking location. BestParking is not liable for road closures or changing traffic conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to comply with any and all rules or regulations posted by garage operators. If a parking facility allows tailgating on its premises, it is your responsibility to comply and check any local city ordinance codes on what is permissible (e.g., no open flames, no cooking, etc.).\r\n\r\nResale of BestParking parking passes is not permitted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDrive Up Mobile Payments: Drive Up Mobile Payments is an in-app feature that will allow you to pay for off-street parking at a gated parking garage by simply using your smart mobile device and the BestParking App. In order to use this feature, you must have an account with us. This feature is used when you do not reserve parking at a specific location before arriving at the parking garage and you pull a ticket at the entrance; therefore only use this feature if you have not pre-booked parking using the BestParking App.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n\r\nAt participating parking locations, drive up to the entrance gate and push the button to pull a ticket;\r\n\r\nPark your car in any open parking spot not marked reserved;\r\n\r\nOpen the BestParking App and select Scan My Ticket;\r\n\r\nScan the ticket you pulled when you entered the garage by taking a picture in the App;\r\n\r\nSelect your form of payment and confirm purchase;\r\n\r\nGo about your day or enjoy your event;\r\n\r\nReturn to your car when you are ready;\r\n\r\nInsert your ticket at the exit gate of the garage; and\r\n\r\nReceive confirmation and receipt of payment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive Up Mobile Payments allows for you to estimate your total for parking after you scan your ticket. All estimates are simply that, an estimate and are not guaranteed to the be the final cost of your parking transaction and are based on your estimated time of exit. The final cost of parking is charged to your selected method of payment upon your exit of the garage and is calculated based upon your entrance and exit times and the rates charged by the parking garage. By using this feature, you agree to your selected method of payment being charged upon your exit from the garage. All parking prices are set directly by the parking garage owner or operator, not BestParking; therefore Drive Up Mobile Payments rates may differ from the drive-up rates posted at a location, if applicable.\r\n\r\nIf you pre-book parking before arriving at a garage and then pull a ticket upon arrival and scan your ticket into the app you may be charged twice for your parking transaction and you may not qualify for a refund if you do not cancel your pre-booked reservation before the start time. Drive Up Mobile Payments transactions cannot be canceled by you or BestParking, once you scan your ticket into the BestParking App the only way to complete a Drive Up Mobile Payments transaction is to successfully exit the garage and pay for the time your vehicle was parked.\r\n\r\nCoupon Use:\r\n\r\nYou are required to abide by all terms and conditions associated with BestParking coupons and discounts. Accordingly, you may not post or distribute coupon codes in any other manner as all such codes are non-transferable and are generally intended only for one-time use. BestParking, in its sole discretion, may suspend your account for violation of this term. Furthermore, any continued violations may result in the immediate termination of any and all of your accounts, without notice. BestParking reserves the right to seek any and all legal remedies available to us, both at law and in equity; including, but not limited to, monetary damages or injunctive relief.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you have a coupon that automatically applies to any booking on your account, it can only be used when you are signed into that account and will not be applied to any bookings made under a guest account. Additionally, any credits you may receive, for any reason, can only be used when you are logged into your account and will not be transferred to another user’s account or booking made from a different account.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCancellations and Refunds:\r\n\r\nAny reservation is fully refundable up to the start of that reservation unless specifically noted otherwise. You can cancel your reservation at any time up to the start of your reservation.

It is within our sole discretion, provided the circumstances, to offer you an account credit if you attempt to cancel a reservation after the start time. If you are unable to park due to the lack of parking spaces of false information provided by a garage, it will be the responsibility of the garage operator to refund you for your reservation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the circumstances surrounding postponed events are unpredictable. Although we will try to help you resolve your parking situation, we are not responsible for postponed events, partial performances, or venue, date, or time changes. No refunds will be issued.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNon-Reserved Parking Options:\r\n\r\nWhile BestParking may provide you with information and data about Garage locations and On Street parking options that are not available for reservation via the BestParking Sites, if you chose to park at one of these parking options you assume all risks and responsibilities associated with parking your vehicle at such locations including but not limited to, difference in prices, parking violation tickets, towing, or the booting of your vehicle. Any prices shown for these types of parking locations are estimates only and BestParking is not responsible or liable to you if the prices vary at the actual parking location. For On Street Parking it is your responsibility to follow any and all parking related street signs. BestParking will not be responsible if you receive a parking ticket, your vehicle is towed or booted and/or for any property damage and BestParking will not reimburse you for any expenses relating to On Street parking.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditional Terms and Conditions Specific to Sellers\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOrder of Precedence: In the event that a Seller has entered into a separate written Seller Agreement with BestParking and such Seller Agreement includes terms or conditions that conflict with the terms and conditions in this Part III, the terms and conditions of the Seller Agreement shall govern.\r\n\r\nNon-Solicit: Each party shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, during the term of the Agreement and for two (2) years after the termination of the Agreement, directly or indirectly, on your own behalf or on the behalf of a third party, solicit or employ any employee of the other party or its affiliates without written consent of the other party; provided that, neither party shall be precluded from hiring any person who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement not targeted specifically at employees of the other party or its affiliates.\r\n\r\nYou agree that violation of this section will result in irreparable harm to BestParking and that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate BestParking for such violation. Thus, BestParking shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including but not limited to specific performance or injunctive relief to enforce this section.
